üß™ Testing Approach
This project was developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD):
TDD Process Followed:

‚úÖ Red: Write failing tests first
‚úÖ Green: Write minimum code to pass tests
‚úÖ Refactor: Improve code while keeping tests passing
‚úÖ Repeat: Continue for each new feature


Test Coverage:

Unit Tests: Individual class functionality testing
Integration Tests: Full system workflow testing
Edge Cases: Error conditions and boundary value testing
User Story Validation: Each requirement tested thoroughly

üîß Technical Implementation
Architecture

Object-Oriented Design: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated classes
Data Persistence: CSV-based storage with automatic backup
Error Handling: Comprehensive exception management
Input Validation: All user inputs validated and sanitized

Key Classes

Account: Manages individual account operations with overdraft protection
Customer: Handles customer information and authentication
BankingSystem: Coordinates all operations and manages data persistence

Design Patterns Used

MVC Pattern: Separation of data (models), logic (controllers), and interface (views)
Repository Pattern: Data access abstraction through CSV handling
Strategy Pattern: Different account types with consistent interfaces
